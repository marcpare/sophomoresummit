		<h1>More about the Summit</h1>
		<p>
		Sophomore Summit is an overnight retreat aimed at re-energizing the second-year
		class amidst the dreaded "Sophomore Slump". Whether you're in the middle of the "slump",
		have friends that have left Tech, or just want to help address a problem that
		affects nearly every aspect of campus life, you're encouraged to apply.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Summit will be action-oriented and fast-paced. Participants from all over campus
		will get a chance to meet and discuss an issue that has far-reaching implication
		for the Tech community. Hopefully, with a combination of solid speakers, team-building
		activities, and a diverse range of ideas and opinions, the Summit will inspire
		something that Georgia Tech has never seen before.
		</p>
