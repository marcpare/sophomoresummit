		<h1>Hey! Are you a Sophomore at Georgia Tech?</h1>
		<p>
		If so, keep reading. We've got an incredible opportunity for Tech's
		second year students that want to make a big impact on campus.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Something funny is going on here...</h1>
		<p>
		Have you noticed a scary trend affecting second year Tech students?
		They're all leaving! Whether it's difficult coursework, a lack of direction,
		or the infamous "sophomore slump", there's something that's causing students
		to leave our campus, and we want to find out how to make it worth staying. 
		</p>
		<h1>That's where you come in</h1>
		<p>
		We (a small committee of fellow second years) want you to help figure out
		what to do about the problem. We're calling it "Sophomore Summit". It'll take
		place April 4-5 at a nearby outdoor center. Click below to find out more details
		(did we mention President Clough was going to be there?)

		<h1>Think you got what it takes?</h1>
		<p>
		If so, fill out our online application and prepare yourself for an intense
		weekend of brainstorming and problem solving. We're looking for a diverse range
		of leaders on campus to bring perspective from every facet of Tech life. Anyone and
		everyone is encouraged to apply. We're not going to bring the typical group of
		"leaders" along for a fun weekend; we want the best and the brightest to work
		hard at a solution to a very real problem.
